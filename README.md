# CityU-Tracker
A community-driven, anonymous admissions tracker built for students at my university in Macau. The platform allows students to share their graduate school application results—such as offers, rejections, GPA, GRE/IELTS scores, and program details—while protecting their privacy. The goal is to give future applicants transparent, reliable insights into where students with similar backgrounds have been admitted, and to help them make informed decisions when applying abroad.

Unlike traditional agencies or limited official reports, this tracker is open, student-centered, and data-driven, built to grow naturally as more users contribute.
